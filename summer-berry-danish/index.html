<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>Dough</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup (250ml) warm whole milk (110-115¬∞F)</li>
<li>1 (0.25oz) package (7g) or 2 1/4 teaspoons Red Star Active Dry Yeast</li>
<li>3 cups (360g) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon table salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup (113g) cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
<li>3 large egg yolks</li>
<li>Egg Wash: 1 large egg + 1 teaspoon water; whisk together</li>
</ul>
<p>Filling</p>
<ul>
<li>üå°Ô∏è 1 (8oz) package (226g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
<li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>2 cups berries (raspberries, blueberries and blackberries), frozen are OK</li>
</ul>
<p>Icing</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup (227g) powdered sugar, sifted</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons milk or cream</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the dough: Combine the warm milk and yeast and stir slightly to combine. Let sit for 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, combine the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Grate cold butter to the mix.</li>
<li>Whisk together the yeast mixture and the egg yolks and add all at once to the flour mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon just until it forms a sticky dough. Do not knead.</li>
<li>‚è≥‚ùÑÔ∏è  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours.</li>
<li>Turn out the chilled dough onto a floured surface and roll it into a large rectangle about 15 inches wide. Fold the dough in thirds like you would a business letter, then roll it out again. Repeat 2 more times.</li>
<li>‚è≥‚ùÑÔ∏è  Fold the dough in thirds again and cover with plastic wrap. Chill for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days.</li>
<li>Make the filling: With either a mixer or by hand, beat the cream cheese, sugar and egg until smooth.</li>
<li>Assemble the braid: Divide the chilled dough into two equal pieces. Roll each half out into an approximate 12√ó6-inch rectangle. Transfer each rectangle to its own a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Score the rectangle so that it is divided into thirds lengthwise, careful not to slice all the way through. You will use this as a guide.</li>
<li>With a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut the outer thirds into twelve 1-inch strips at a slight angle.</li>
<li>Remove the 2 segments from the top of the dough and bottom of the dough, leaving 2 flaps.</li>
<li>Spread filling into the center of each dough rectangle, leaving about 1 inch border at the top and bottom. Top with berries or desired fruit.</li>
<li>To make a faux braid, fold top and bottom flaps over filling. Starting at the top, take one dough strip and fold it over the filling. Fold the dough strip from the other side over the top, overlapping the first one slightly. Repeat all the way down.</li>
<li>‚è≥ Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 30 minutes, or until indentation remains after lightly touching with fingertip.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 375¬∞F.</li>
<li>When ready to bake, brush with egg wash. Bake until crust is golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
<li>Make the icing: Whisk together the powdered sugar and milk or cream until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled Danish braid. Serve and enjoy!</li>
